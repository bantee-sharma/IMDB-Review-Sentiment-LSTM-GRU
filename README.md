# IMDB-Review-Sentiment-LSTM-GRU
IMDb Sentiment Analysis using LSTM and GRU

This repository contains a sentiment analysis project for IMDb movie reviews, implemented using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) models. The goal of this project is to predict the sentiment (positive or negative) of movie reviews from IMDb's large dataset.

Features:
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): A type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is effective in learning long-term dependencies in sequential data.
GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit): A simpler variant of LSTM that is computationally efficient while maintaining performance.
Preprocessing: Includes text preprocessing steps such as tokenization, padding, and word embedding for deep learning models.
Model Performance: Comparison of the performance of LSTM and GRU on the IMDb dataset.
Requirements:
Python 3.x
TensorFlow/Keras
Numpy, Pandas
Scikit-learn
